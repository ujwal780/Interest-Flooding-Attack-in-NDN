# Interest-Flooding-Attack-in-NDN
Interest Flooding Attacks (IFA) overload routers and interfere with network functions, which makes them a serious danger to Named Data Networking (NDN). This work uses throughput statistics from NS3 simulations to examine the efficacy of mitigating methods. Considerable imbalances during an IFA are shown by the analysis. Throughput on one node (the prospective attacker) is unnaturally high, exceeding 1750 Mbps, while other nodes suffer from lower throughput as a result of congestion, reaching as low as 17.54 Mbps. This impedes the movement of lawful commerce. To rectify this imbalance, the SatisfactionBasedPushback strategy and Satisfaction Based Interest Acceptance strategy (PBIA) approach is used. Prioritizing authentic traffic, PBIA dynamically modifies forwarding based on satisfaction ratings. After mitigation, the analysis demonstrates a shift towards balanced throughput distribution. Node 4's throughput reaches a more tolerable level for legitimate data transfer, Node 1's throughput drastically decreases (suppressing attacker traffic by almost 96%), and Node 0's throughput climbs greatly (to 154.00 Mbps). These outcomes demonstrate how well PBIA works in reducing IFA and improving network performance in NDN.  
We used NDNSim, NS3, and CPP as a technology.
